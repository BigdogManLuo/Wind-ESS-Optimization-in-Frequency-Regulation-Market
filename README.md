# Wind-ESS-Optimization-in-Frequency-Regulation-Market
Code implementation of “Flexible Coordination of Wind Generators and Energy Storages in joint Energy and Frequency Regulation Market“

<br>

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Numba 0.55.1
### Installing

1.Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BigdogManLuo/Wind-ESS-Optimization-in-Frequency-Regulation-Market.git
```
2.Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install numba
```

## Usage


The base folder is a basic simulation example, you can run the numerical experiment as follows.
```sh
cd base
python 01_DP.py
python 02_RealTimeOpt.py
```

However,we recommend to use Spyder IDE to run the code for subsequent observation, debugging and modification.You can follow the steps below:


1.Open the repository in Spyder IDE.

2.In Spyder IDE, execute the code cell by cell to observe and modify the code in real time.

3.Use the Spyder debugger to debug the code if necessary.

Please note that these instructions assume that you have already installed Spyder IDE and have a basic understanding of how to use it.
